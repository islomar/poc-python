##What Tornado is about
Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed. By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.

The Tornado web framework and HTTP server together offer a full-stack alternative to WSGI. While it is possible to use the Tornado web framework in a WSGI container (WSGIAdapter), or use the Tornado HTTP server as a container for other WSGI frameworks (WSGIContainer), each of these combinations has limitations and to take full advantage of Tornado you will need to use the Tornadoâ€™s web framework and HTTP server together.


##Asynchronous and non-Blocking I/O
Real-time web features require a long-lived mostly-idle connection per user. In a traditional synchronous web server, this implies devoting one thread to each user, which can be very expensive.

To minimize the cost of concurrent connections, Tornado uses a **single-threaded event loop**. This means that **all application code should aim to be asynchronous and non-blocking because only one operation can be active at a time**.

There are many styles of asynchronous interfaces:
* Callback argument
* Return a placeholder (Future, Promise, Deferred)
* Deliver to a queue
* Callback registry (e.g. POSIX signals)

##Ideas for Alea
* Everything async.
* Use of (Futures)[http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/async.html].
