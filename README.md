###Chapter 1: Meet Python
* IDLE: Integrated Development Environment
* The characters `>>>` are called 'triple chevron'.
* Python code needs to be indented (instead of C-like languages which use {}).
* BIF: built-in function
* It is case sensitive!
* Lists can contain anything!
* `isinstance(variableName, variableType)` 
* This Python philosophy is known as “batteries included”: there’s enough included with Python to let you do most things well, without having to rely on code from third parties to get going
